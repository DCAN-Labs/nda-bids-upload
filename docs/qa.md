# Contact the NDA for Quality Assessment

If you have validated that the `upload.py` script was successful, you need to contact the NDA as soon as possible after uploading to indicate that you are ready for them to perform the NDA's Quality Assurance (QA) checks on the collection's data. Below is an email template for requesting this.

    Hello,
    I am working with [Lab PI name] at [University]. I have recently completed an upload submission for [NDA Collection Name] and am I am writing to request that QA be performed. Thank you for the help. Let us know if there are any issues. 


If the upload was not successful, read the NDA-specific upload log files, double-check the standard output streams (stdout) of your upload script runs, and double-check the submission status within your NDA collection's website tab under "Submissions". If you are still having issues, contact the NDA Help Desk.
