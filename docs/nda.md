#Advice for working with the NDA

## NDA Upload Limitations

The NDA as limitations in terms of the amount of data their system can recieve at a time. We have typically had success with 5 batches of 500 subjects' files. We typically upload ABCD-BIDS derivatives, so your mileage may vary.

## Pulling Your Data from the NDA

If someone wants to pull the data that has been uploaded, please direct them to this repository: [nda-abcd-s3-downloader](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/nda-abcd-s3-downloader).

## Gaining Permission to Upload to the NDA

Post a GitHub issue to [this repository](https://github.com/DCAN-Labs/nda-bids-upload/) requesting permission to upload with your NDA username. Someone will let you know when you have been granted permission and close the GitHub issue.

To validate that you have been granted permission to upload to the NDA, you can check through the following steps:

1. Log into [the NDA website](nda.nih.gov).

2. Navigate to your dashboard.

3. Click on "Collections(#)" on the right hand side of the page.

4. Your Permissions for DCAN Labs ABCD-BIDS Community Collection (ABCC) should say "Submission" and "Query."

## Data Availability

After you submit your data for upload and validate that the submission was successful, the data can take anywhere from 2 weeks to several months to appear on the NDA to be downloaded by other users.
